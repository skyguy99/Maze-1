Maze1 is supported in Unity 5 or higher.
Main script explanations for editing and additions to Maze 1:

> GameLogic.cs - contains definitions for majority of all gameplay functions and variables for levels 1-3
  - roundReset() is called by Round Canvas "Advance button" - this func stops the timer, resets player position, increments round number, and contains reference to move.cs and CardboardReticle.cs
  - alterCanvasDirection() alters canvas position and rotation in accordance with rotation of Cardboard Head (headRot variable)
  - cubeFound() increments score (# of times cube found) and resets static cubeFound variable in CardboardReticle.cs
  - gameOverImagesUpdate() and gameOverImagesUpdate2() reposition and set correct sprite to images in game over canvas and giv up canvas based on round complete booleans
  - Start() func resets all static variables 
  - Update() func contains statements that check if static cubeFound variable has been triggered, disables game canvases and updates text on canvases (use this for debugging)

> move.cs - enables in game movement using touch controls by adding forward force to rigidbody attached to CardboardMain object
  - Defines static moveEnabled boolean to disable/enable movement via GameLogic.cs
  - FixedUpdate() adds Vector3 force to rigidbody, moves Main Cardboard camera, and calls StickToGroundHelper () and GroundCheck ()
  - GroundCheck () sphere casts down beyond bottom of the capsule collider in Cardboard object to see if the capsule is colliding round the bottom
  - GetInput () returns a Vector3 for movement in FixedUpdate() based on user touch/mouse click
  - StickToGroundHelper () keeps Cardboard rigidbody from toppling over by sphere casting below capsule collider
  
> ViewSwap.cs - enables and disables Cardboard VR mode when switching to Cam2 monoscopic camera and back to MainCamera stereoscopic camera under Cardboard object
  - Alters visibility of Trail Renderer attached to Cardboard object for user tracking in Switch() function
  - Switchback() returns to VR mode after WaitForSeconds call
  - ActivateVRMode(bool) disables or enables objects in mono object array and cardboard object array in accordance with boolean value (whether going to or from VR mode)
  - Switch() called by "View Path" button in round canvas and Cardboard.SDK.OnBackButton/escape button to switch to overview map 

> spawnCube.cs - spawns cubes in game by generating a random vector position within the confines of each scene's maze. 
  - Ranges for the x and z values of the vector must be updated in accordance with any new mazes added. 
  - Reference getCube.cs for collision detection. 
  
> email.cs - sends data report to developer address to be REPLACED BY DEVELOPER on line 40
  - Reference to UIManagerScript.cs for and selectManager.cs for round number and maze level title
  - connects to gmail port 587 to send from the Maze1 email address
  - Reference to GameLogic.cs for round completion

> getCube.cs - detects cube collision with maze walls during spawn by spawnCube.cs to avoid cubes spawning into walls
  - OnCollisionStay(Collision) tests for collision with Cardboard object or Maze walls and destroys cube if touching to trigger respawn
